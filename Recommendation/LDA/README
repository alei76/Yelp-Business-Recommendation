We have used a lot of libraries to develop our project. For the LDA part, they are:
1. Python2.7 (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
2. NumPy (http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html)
3. SciPy (http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html)
4. Gensim (http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html)
5. MRJob (https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob)
6. NLTK (http://nltk.org/)

After the installation, you will also need the yelp dataset from:
http://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recruiting/data

Then you will have to use the code in categorize_review to categorize the data.

After that, you should be able to use the code in lda_gensim to run the lda model.

Finally, when the lda model produces the result, you can use the code in visualization to perform the visualization.

I know, this instruction is far away from comprehensive. You will have to figure
out quite a bit input/output in order to use it. And the environment
configuration is not funny at all. So if you do want to try out the code but
can't figure it out, feel free to contact myself (junyang.xin@nyu.edu).
